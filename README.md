Welcome to the official transcript repository for the **[Github Coding Matrix](https://www.youtube.com/@GithubCodingMatrix)** YouTube channel.

## 📖 About This Repository

This repository serves as the textual knowledge base for my video tutorials and research sessions. Instead of raw code, you will find the **full transcripts** and research notes for my deep dives into Computer Science "First Principles."

I created this archive to make the video content searchable and accessible. Whether you are looking for specific explanations on Operating Systems, Database Internals, or Discrete Math, you can use these text files to study the concepts discussed in the videos at your own pace.

## 📂 How to Use

* **Search:** Use the repository search bar (or `Ctrl+F` inside files) to find specific keywords, definitions, or historical facts mentioned in the videos.
* **Study:** Use these transcripts as study notes to reinforce the complex topics covered on the channel.
* **Translate:** Feel free to use these transcripts to translate the content into other languages.
